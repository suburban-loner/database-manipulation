# Database Manipulation
This program demonstrates basic database manipulation using SQLite in Python. The program creates a table, inserts data, performs updates, deletions, and queries records based on specific conditions.

## Features
### The program performs the following database operations:

### Create a Table:

A table called python_programming is created with columns for id, name, and grade.
### Insert Data:

#### The following rows are inserted into the python_programming table:

id	name	grade
55	Carl Davis	61
66	Dennis Fredrickson	88
77	Jane Richards	78
12	Peyton Sawyer	45
2	Lucas Brooke	99

#### Select Records by Grade:
The program selects and displays all records where the grade is between 60 and 80.

#### Update a Record:
Carl Davisâ€™s grade is updated from 61 to 65.

#### Delete a Record:
The row for Dennis Fredrickson is deleted from the table.

#### Update Records with IDs Below 55:
The program updates the grade of all people with an id below 55.
